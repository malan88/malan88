# 👋 Hi,

I'm Michael Sendker, a software developer from Central Florida obsessed with learning new things. 

I've written in a lot of languages and a lot of frameworks. You can see a lot of my work [here][0] on my homepage. I also [write sometimes][1], about whatever's interesting me, which means a lot of philosophy. I recently wrote a 5,000 word essay on the [Negroni and political psychology][2].

Also, here's my [résumé][3]. If you're interested in hiring me, you can email me: `m (at) standingwater (dot) io`.
