# ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

I'm Michael Sendker, a software developer from Central Florida obsessed with learning new things. 

I've written in a lot of languages and a lot of frameworks. You can see a lot of my work [here][0] on my homepage. I also [write sometimes][1], about whatever's interesting me, which means a lot of philosophy. I recently wrote a 5,000 word essay on the [Negroni and political psychology][2].

Before you ask, my avatar is not me, it is from my favorite film, [Jean Cocteau's OrphÃ©e][4]. I use it everywhere.

If you're interested in hiring me, here's my [rÃ©sumÃ©][3], and you can email me: `m (at) standingwater (dot) io`.
